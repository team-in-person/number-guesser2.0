# event-driven-app

In this app, the server will guess a random number, automated clients will then guess a random number, and the one closest to that number is the winner.
This happens every 10s.

## Requirements:
A “hub” server that moderates all events
Multiple “clients” that connect to the hub which can both publish and subscribe to events
Must operate over a network
