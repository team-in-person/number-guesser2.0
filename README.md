# event-driven-app
- CAPS Phase 1: Begin the build of an application for a product called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, we’ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, each vendor will be notified that their customers received what they purchased.

- This will be an event driven application that “distributes” the responsibility for logging to separate modules, using only events to trigger logging based on activity.
